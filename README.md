# MADS-Capstone
* This is the repo for our MADS capstone project, dedicated to revealing the nature of disaster-related tweets. 
* The tweet corpus we use come from the [HumAID dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03090), which is fully open-access on the [CrisisNLP website](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset.html) (we also scraped for additional information on the tweets with Tweepy and the Twitter API).
* You can read more about our project through the blogpost [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0B3Hln6zf0LpECzSYjiYQDIOZwNrvWw/view?usp=sharing).
